"Yo! [player]! Am I having déjà vu, [catchphrase]? Didn't we just talk?"
"[Greeting]! Whatcha want, [catchphrase]?"
"Hey! If it isn't [player]! How's my training buddy today? Check out this bod! [catchphrase]!"
"Heya, [player]! You training today, [catchphrase]? Don't slack just 'cause it's sunny! Whatcha need?"
"Heya! What is it this time, [catchphrase]?"
"Oh! [player]! Whatcha need now, [catchphrase]?"
"Oh?! Oh, you again. What now, [catchphrase]?!"
"[player], I don't think you even have a question. I think you just like talking to me! Is it my animal magnetism? What can I do for you, [catchphrase]?"
"Rushing up to tale to me like that... Geez, you're impatient! What's so important, [catchphrase]?"
"[player]! Big favor for you! The other day I set a world record for the 100-meter dash. But no one was there to see it! So if you could go ahead and spread the news, that would be great! Thanks, bud! [catchphrase]!"
"Hey, [player]! Check me out! ...No, I'm not talking about my clothes! I wanted you to appreciate my rippling muscles! I think of clothes as the icing on the scrumptious cake that is my jaw-dropping physique! Haha!"
"I love it when the weather is like this! You can do weight training or just stay inside and watch sports!"
"Ugh... I just bit it back there! But all this gravel stuck to my leg feels right! Nothing says "man" like a gravel-covered knee, [catchphrase]!"
"What? You want me for some new sports league too? Man, I'm totally in demand! The other day this guy comes by wanting me to sign up for his new muay Thai venture. I was like, 'Sorry, bro! I'm totally booked up right now!' I gotta tell ya, [player], it felt kinda bad to break his heart like that..."
"Well, [player], sometimes you just gotta let out a big roar straight from your gut! OK, then! Let's roar together! Ready... Set... Tomorrow is a new day! Did you get a good shout going? If not, try doing a few sit-ups once in a while, [catchphrase]!"
"I may have strong biceps but it doesn't mean I'll never get hurt inside, even I get sad once in a while!"
