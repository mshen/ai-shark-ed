"If you take care of your flowers just right, sometimes you can get rare-colored flowers to bloom. It has a lot to do with where you plant 'em. Like, you can crossbreed flowers that are next to each other. When it happens, you'll be like, "Man, I'm glad I took care of those little flowers dudes!" [catchphrase]!"
"Oh no! I was supposed to call my mom yesterday! Oh, man... I didn't answer her last letter, so I bet she's gonna be mad at me. It's nice that she cares about me, though! [catchphrase]!
"When there aren't any big festivals coming up, you get to focus on your hobbies! It's like, uh, what's it called? Keeping your work and your play separate from each other? Course, festivals count as play too, I guess! [catchphrase]!"
"When you're looking up at the sky... sometimes balloons just come flying outta nowhere, right? What I wanna know is...who the heck is sending 'em out? But I guess it's cool for a mystery to stay a mystery sometimes! [catchphrase]!"
"Oh, right! Yeah, I wanted to run something by you. So, uh...think you could bring me a pear? Lately I'm on a crazy new pear kick! I need as many as I can get, so I'm asking everyone I know for help! Ya feel me? Get me a pear!"
"Uhhh... I was gonna say something, but I can't remember what it was... Sorry, [player], but could you just leave me alone for a bit? I need to think, [catchphrase]."
"Umm... Umm... C'mon, c'mon! Gotta figure this out! Huh? [player]? You'll listen to my problems? Yeah, that's nice, I guess. But I want to figure this out myself! Leave me be, [catchphrase]!"
Heya, [player]! Heh... Made ya look, [catchphrase]!"
"Oh, [player]! Good to see ya, [catchphrase]!"
"Oho! [player]! Howdy! catchphrase! So...is there something you need from me?"
"Yo, [player]! You get around, eh? [catchphrase]!"
"[player]! I'm seeing you a lot today, [catchphrase]!"
"...[player]! What's the hurry, [catchphrase]?"
"Whoa, [player]! Simmer down! [catchphrase]!"
