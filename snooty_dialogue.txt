"Hello again! Need something, [player]?"
"Hello, [player]! You have something else to talk about today? So what did you want, [player]?"
"Can I help you, [player]?"
"Can I do something else for you, [player], [catchphrase]?"
"Well, hello again. Aren't you busy, [player]! So, what did you want, [player]?"
"What can I do for you, [player], [catchphrase]?"
"What, you again, [player]? How many times has it BEEN, [catchphrase]?"
"Hello again, [player]. I'm always glad to talk with you. Even this much, [catchphrase]. So what did you want, [player]?"
"[catchphrase], you look like a rock star... or a celebrity... Or someone who's really good at thrift-store shopping!"
"I can't believe I had to put on sunscreen today. Wait, I wear sunscreen every day. Ignore me."
"I don't know if you believe in luck, [player], but I sure do. There are certain items I just KNOW are lucky. I have one I carry around all the time. It just so happens my lucky object goes really well with most of my outfits. What a coincidence! So if you find yourself in need for a lucky break or two, think about picking up a lucky charm. I'd recomment one that matches your eye color."
"Have you ever seen an aurora, [player]? It's magical...and we may get one tonight! So keep your eyes open, and count your lucky stars if we do see one..."
"You know what? I can't think of a single event coming up soon. I guess that means I'll finally have time to catch up on my weeding. And my shell collection could use a little work. Some pretty ones have been washing up recently. Come to think of it, I don't have any time for events! [catchphrase]!"
"I hate to do this to you, [player], but could you come back and talk to me later? I just remembered something really important I need to take care of right now!"
"How can I put this nicely... Let's see...BUZZ OFF! Sorry, [player]. I'm having a bad day."
"Shouldn't you get going, [player]? I heard you don't have much time left to pay off that loan..."
