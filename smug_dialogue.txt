"How goes it, [player]! If I may be so bold, you're looking as cool as a fair number of cucumbers."
"Hey, [player]. I feel like we need more dancing happening right now. Shoom! (does flourish emotion) OK, that's a little better."
"Hi. Seems quiet today, huh? Like, too quiet. [catchphrase]."
"You again, [player]? Well, that makes this a good day! A great day even! [catchphrase]!"
"Hi. Nothing like a chat with me to brighten your day, yeah?"
"Hi. I knew you couldn't stay away! I can't blame you! [catchphrase]!"
"Whoa. You again? We're meeting a lot today, [catchphrase]."
"You know, I feel like there are a lot fewer weeds around town lately, [player]. I wonder if someone is pulling all the weeds on a regular basis."
"How do I look? I tried to look sharp in my clothes today... Maybe I'm being too adventurous, but then again maybe I'm NOT, [catchphrase]. I'll try to tell myself that clothes ALWAYS feel strange the first time you wear them."
"What? You...had that hairstyle the last time I saw you... It's good you have your own style there. You should stick to it as long as you want, [catchphrase]!"
"Could you just leave me alone for now? I'm having a moment of melancholy..."
"Haa... huh? Right now I feel that my heart is broken and will never be fixed again..."
