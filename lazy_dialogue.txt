"Hey again, [player]. What can I help you with this time, [catchphrase]?"
"Hi again, [player]. What's happening, [catchphrase]?"
"Hi again, [player]! What's up now, [catchphrase]?"
"Hi, [player]! What's shaking, [catchphrase]?"
"Is everything OK with you, [player]? What do you want to talk about now, [catchphrase]?"
"So we meet again. What can I do for you, [catchphrase]?"
"Aw, are you feeling lonely! Well, what do you want to chat about, [catchphrase]?"
"Calm down, [player]. I want you to speak slowly, [catchphrase]!"
"Hey there! Look at us bumping into each other again, [catchphrase]. So, anyway, what's up?"
"Don't worry. I've always got time for you, [player]. Well then, what can I do for you?"
"Hi, Player! Have you seen the sky tonight? The stars are sooo sweet! They're like pieces of rock candy!"
"I've always dreamed of having a secret lair. That would seriously be one of the best things about being a superhero. The only problem is that I'd want to brag about it. But then it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Hmm. I'd better think about this a little more."
"Our town seems a lot cleaner than before. There's not much trash or weeds, and the air is really fresh. I'm pretty sure it's all because of the work you put in place, [catchphrase]."
"I'm flattered you want to chat so much, [player]. But I've got some important things on my mind, so let's talk later, [catchphrase]."
"So if I do that, I'll have to take care of that other thing. But that other thing is a problem too... Oh, you kind of caught me in the middle of working out a problem. Talk to me later, OK?"
"Sorry, but I can't talk right now. I actually need to focus on something else."
