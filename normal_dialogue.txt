"Good morning, [player]!"
"Hello again! How can I help, [catchphrase]?"
"Hi, [player]. Need to chat about something, [catchphrase]?"
"Hi, [player]! Sunny mornings just make me want to dance, [catchphrase]."
"Hi, [player]! What's going on, [catchphrase]?"
"Hi, [player]! What can I do for you, [catchphrase]?"
"Hi there, [player]! It's nice to see so much of you today, [catchphrase]."
"Hello again. Doing all right, [catchphrase]?"
"Wow! I can't seem to bump into anyone else today, [player]!"
"Yaaay, it's [player] again! The sun might have gone to sleep, but that doesn't mean we have to!"
"[player]! It's been fun seeing you so many times today, [catchphrase]. So, what can I do for you?"
"[player] again! What can I do for you, [catchphrase]?"
"I'm sorry. I just want to be left alone right now... [catchphrase]."
"I've really enjoyed chatting with you. But the thing is, I need a little time to myself now... If you still want to talk later, I'll be around."
"I'm sorry, but there's something else I need to concentrate on. I feel bad for brushing you off when you've been so kind, but let's talk more later."
"What to do, what to do... Oh! Excuse me! I was so lost in thought, I didn't even notice you! I'd love to chat, but I just can't right now. Later, OK?"
"Oh! Oops! Didn't see you there! I've just got something on my mind right now... I need some more time to think it over. Let's catch up later!"
"ACK! Y-You startled me. Sorry, I'm a little preoccupied right now. Can whatever it is wait?"
